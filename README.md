CountDown
=========
This javascript aims to display the countdown days before the prescribed deadline in .html files, e.g., 2013.10.31 23:59:00.

Created by patriclouis @ ZJU on Oct. 3, 2013.

********************
Samples:

In the HTML file, you can insert the following codes between "\<body> ... \</body>", i. e.,

<b><font color="#0000FF">There are only </font><font color="#FF0000"<span id="countdowndays" style="align: center"></span>
</font>&nbsp;<font color="#0000FF">before the deadline of CVPR2014.</font></b><br>

<script type="text/javascript" src="js/countdown.js"></script>

Here, id is "countdowndays", which should be kept to be inconsistent with that in countdown.js. Notice that the deadline 
can be substituted by the desired on by updating the time in "Deadline = new Date("2013/10/31 23:59:00")" as expected.

Anyway, all comments on this script is appreciated to be sent to patriclouis.lee@gmail.com.
